<h4>Offered a assistant professor in TU Eindhoven</h4>
{% highlight ruby %}
After 4 years of struggle after my doctorate, it is my pleasure to announce that I am selected for an assistant professor position at
Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands for the Computational Illumination group, in the same department I completed my PhD from.
The greatest home coming of my life and a dream come true :). Thanks to all my family and friends for their never-ending support through the years.
