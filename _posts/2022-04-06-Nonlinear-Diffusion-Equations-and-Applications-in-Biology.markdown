Nonlinear diffusion equations play an increasingly important role in the modelling of complex biological processes such as biofilm growth, cancer cell invasion and cell migration. 
Recent advances in analytical techniques allow us to investigate qualitative properties of solutions that can be applied to validate current models or to suggest novel modelling approaches.


This conference aims to bring together the theory of nonlinear diffusion equations with its modelling applications in biology.  The invited speakers are renowned national and international experts in mathematical biology and 
in the analysis of partial differential equations.  By enhancing the interactions between these fields we aspire to stride towards addressing important open problems in the analysis of partial differential equations and in 
mathematical biology.
